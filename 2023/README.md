# Advent of Code - 2023

This year, wil use a single folder/package for helpers. Makes it easier to re-use each day & modify in one place if need-be

To do this, I did the following:

> Add a folder for the helper .py files
> Add a single (empty) .py file == "\__init__.py"
> Add the different helper module .py files
