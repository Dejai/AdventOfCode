    For every entry in the 2D array, just store what is surrounding it as neighbors
    Then, some neighbors are of type = Pipe, while others are just ground
    And, not every pipe connects, so some neighbors can be excluded if they aren't reachable. 

For each pipe:
    The pipe can only accept certain neighbors (depending on what type/direction)
    So, two nodes in the 2D array can only be added if they have acceptable joining types

Pipe Types:
    | is a vertical pipe connecting north and south.
    - is a horizontal pipe connecting east and west.
    L is a 90-degree bend connecting north and east.
    J is a 90-degree bend connecting north and west.
    7 is a 90-degree bend connecting south and west.
    F is a 90-degree bend connecting south and east.

Might just be easier to say that every pipe only takes the 4 main cardinal points

ALLOWED pipe Connections:
    "|" -- L, J, 7, F, |
    "-" -- L, J, 7, F, -
    "L" -- J, 7, F, -, |
    "J" -- L, 7, F, -, |
    "7" -- L, J, F, -, |
    "F" -- L, J, 7, -, |
NOT ALLOWED pipe connections 
    | --> 
Allows vs. Not-Allowed Pipe Connections:

        | + L
        | + J
